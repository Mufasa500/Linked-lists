# Linked-lists

This code defines a generic LinkedList class that implements the Iterable interface. It has methods to add elements to the list, convert the list to a string, and provide an iterator to traverse the list.

The class also includes four methods that need to be implemented:

nCopies: this method should take a LinkedList of Integers and return an array of ints containing the number of times each unique element appears in the list.
countingSort: this method should implement the counting sort algorithm on a LinkedList of Integers and return the sorted list.
reverse: this method should reverse the order of the elements in the list.
shuffle: this method should randomly shuffle the order of the elements in the list.
The main method is just a simple test that creates a new LinkedList of Integers, adds two elements, and prints the first element using an iterator.
